WordPress Antivirus and Hack protection.

== Description ==

Umbrella helps you protect your WordPress site and checks your plugin and folders for vulnerabilities. 
More functions are planned and will be launched soon. Look for an update :)

Major features in Umbrella include:

* Hide version numbers in your front-end source code for WordPress-core and all of your plugins. 
* Completely turn off trackbacks & pingbacks to your site.
* Block all unauthorized and irrelevant requests through query strings.

== Installation ==

Upload the Umbrella plugin to your blog, Activate it & thats it.

This plugin does nothing by default, and that's because we want you to know whats happening behind the scenes. With that said, please choose wich modules you want to use with Umbrella. Even if nothing is loaded by default, we recommend you to use activate them all for best protection. Cheers =)
